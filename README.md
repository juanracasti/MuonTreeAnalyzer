File description
====

* **muonAnalyzer** contains the main analysis functions.
 
* **RunPROOF_muonAnalyzer** executes muonAnalyzer using PROOF. Edit it if you need to
modify the location of the source rootfiles or add new samples.

* **runAll_muonAnalyzer.sh** is just a quick executable.

The rest of the files shouldn't be modified.

Let's run the code
====

Edit the file runAll_muonAnalyzer.sh:

     cd MuonTreeAnalyzer/src
     vim runAll_muonAnalyzer.sh

Comment/uncomment the necessary lines depending on the samples you want to run.

Now load root and PAF:

    source /gpfs/csic_projects/cms/sw/ROOT/current/root/bin/thisroot.sh
    export PAFPATH=/gpfs/csic_projects/cms/PROOF/paf/
    export PATH=$PAFPATH/bin:$PATH

And run the code:

    ./runAll_muonAnalyzer.sh
